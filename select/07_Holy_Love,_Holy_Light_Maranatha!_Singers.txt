"Vocal Solo by: David Pack of the group Ambrosia"
Holy love, Holy light
Holy fire burning bright
You came to earth to live and die
That we might be forgiven
Holy love, Holy light
Holy Lamb cruciffied
You welcome sinners to Your side
That we might be forgiven
Holy love, Holy light
Holy One we'll sing Your praise forever
Holy love, Holy light
Holy fire burning bright
You came to earth to live and die
That we might be forgiven
Holy love, Holy light
Holy One we'll sing Your praise forever
Holy love, Holy light
Holy fire burning bright
You came to earth to live and die
That we might be forgiven
