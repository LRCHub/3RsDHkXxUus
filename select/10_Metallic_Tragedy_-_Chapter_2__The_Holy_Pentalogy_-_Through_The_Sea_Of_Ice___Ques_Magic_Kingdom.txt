THE WITCH, THE ANGEL, THE KING, THE KNIGHT, AND THE DEMON
QUID HABET AUREM AUDIAT

MORTIS ARBITRIUM, INFERNUS IN TERRA
Ooh, I'm coming from heaven to wake up the king
and his knights, disaster is coming, be careful, Evil is rising
After ten thousand centuries in the shadows of the valley
of Abaddon, the seventh gate of hell is open
My damned children will conquer this world and I'll be free
Darkness's coming!
I will defend
My spell will kill
Arrows will fly
You're gonna cry
Your time has come
You're already dead
You were a friend
I was lying
Deep in the heart of death; black abyss will never taste my
blood and I will be glorious, I'll send you back into your infernal cage
I am Tazira the witch and I will give you temptation
I am the King Dragonson, I promise you death in this satanic war
The Witch, the Angel, the King, the Knight and the Demon
You will pay for this betrayal
Ridiculous soldier, chaos will rule
Your God will fall!
there's only one lord
Our faith is bigger, we're not afraid
Deep in the heart of war, Inferno will never have
my soul, and we'll be victorious, we'll send them
back into their infernal flames
I am the fallen angel
Our reign of terror will come
My King is serving the lord
And our sword will give you the law
The Witch, the Angel, the King, the Knight and the Demon
We're lost in temptation, we want the glory
We'll see the fire, raise this cup of eternity
We are all damned souls, we've lost our liberty
We'll see the liars into this cup of victory
Witch, you've open the gate, you will burn to clear your sins
and your crimes, ooh
Oooh, I'm burning in the flames of Christ, my work is done
but like the phoenix I will rise again...
Oooh; light of truth's too strong, forgive my sins
My son, Army of the Six Golden Towers is ready, guide these
warriors to victory
King, you will die in your holy kingdom and you will
understand my eternal pain
The war is beginning, the beast wants our soul
Holy power will give you the strength to resist his lies
I am back from death and the beast is my father
your golden defenders will kiss my flesh and drink my blood
Knights of the Magic Kingdom, be proud and fight
The light must be back

Now we are victorious, we've sent them back to their infernal flames
Now, we see the light again, Legion of death disappeared
You'll see the baptism of fire when the
black dragon will rise from hell
The Witch, the Angel, the King, the Knight and the Demon

This story will never end 'cause we are in you and we will be back
